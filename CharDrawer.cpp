ideally, it could be like this:

1 xxxxxxxxxxxx
2 xxxxxxxxxxxx
. xxxxxxxxxxxx
4 xxxxxxxxxxxx
5 xxxxxxxxxxxx
6 xxxxxxxxxxxx
7 xxxxxxxxxxxx
8 xxxxxxxxxxxx
9 xxxxxxxxxxxx
10xxxxxxxxxxxx
11xxxxxxxxxxxx

But never mind, this is all I really want:
    .   
 xxxxxxx
.xxxxxxx
 xxxxxxx

really lame, but so what.
honestly, this is actually more effort than I want to put into it....
